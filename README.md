# AQI Data Exploration
 
My parents live in England, and I live in Oakland, California. I've been wanting them to come visit for a while, but the time they usually want to come and visit is in the Fall during fire season. I wanted to show them a chart that shows how unusual the past few years have been for air quality, and what particular times of year appear to be worst, but had trouble finding that particular visualization, so I thought I would take it as an opportunity to create it myself.

In this project I follow a few steps to explore the data both in Jupyter Notebooks and later in Tableau.

**1. Explore a sample API call** to better understand the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) API.

**2. Generate an API request of Oakland's AQI data**.

**3. Exploratory data analysis** on Oakland data.

**4. Generate API requests of full dataset I want** for data analysis in Tableau

**5. Request full dataset and download it for Tableau**

**6. Explore in Tableau.**

**[You can see the final product in Tableau here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/martin.bourqui/viz/WestCoastAirQualityExploration/HowareWestCoastcitiesairqualitychangingovertime)** if you'd prefer to skip the extraction and transformation that takes place in this notebook.
